Ramirez is a collection of useful snippets I've used.

Since it started in a Unity project I've placed the code inside Assets/src,
which makes it easier to use if that's also your intended use.

Tests may be run from Assets/Editor.

Ramirez, remove these diacritics.
Ramirez, copy the modifiers from this GameObject.
Ramirez, get or create the component I need.
Ramirez, stop that nuke with your riot shield.
Ramirez, Do Everything!
